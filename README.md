Operated by a computer vision program, tracking and detecting eyes of the viewer in real-time through an infrared camera. The default dim setting is slowly illuminated after the viewer close their eyes for a few seconds. As the undefined space, only to sense through our eyelids, gradually lightens in a warm wash of luminance, to which all instantly ceases and reverts to darkness upon an opening and blink of an eye(s). 

### 1//
Install necessary dependencies:

cv2

dlib

imutils

scipy

numpy


### 2//
Run main.py(external camera) or main2.py(native camera) from "scripts"

EYE_AR_THRESH to adjust Eye Aspect Ratio Threshold for the computer to better determine open or closed eyes. 





### 3//
Open INRTOSPECT.toe

INTROSPECT v1 : syncs CV detection data saved to local .txt, and controls the projection of a warm halo.

INTROSPECT v1 : based on CV signals, generates YouTube Videos (uses YouTube Data API), also includes 2 postFX (OpticalFlow_GLSL + MovieFeedbackEffect)
